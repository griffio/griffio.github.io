The downside of introducing remote/flexible working are issues of trust and contractual obligations as they exist currently in an organisation.
In such cultures, the mindset is that everyone is distrustful of each other unless they can see them at their desks "working".
If there are problems with adopting remote/flexible working then it signals an organisation that prefers conformity and suffers from group-think.
Distributed working means that work is fanned out where feedback and progress need to be communicated back skillfully.
Co-location is needed where some work is by nature synchronous and must happen at the same time.
Actual and absolute remote working is probably suitable for a minority of people and most people benefit from a degree of flexibilty around commuting (it's not uncommon to see for a contractual 40hr week where on top an extra 15-20hr is spent commuting).
It's not a zero-sum result and a working culture must be based around support for out-of-band communication, at a minimum for disaster recovery scenerios.
Most organisations have distributed interactions that are being performed poorly and are oblivious to the detrimental effects.
You cannot sit next to everyone you have to interact with,
providing Customer support is one example, another is offices in different locations and simply using email to communicate.
