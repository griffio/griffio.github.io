### What is a Remote First culture?

It improves the working practices for employees taking into consideration that time and location should not be a barrier to productivity.

Companies that adopt remote first working practices are going to be way ahead in how their brand is ultimately perceived, i.e the opposite of [Yahoo](http://allthingsd.com/20130222/physically-together-heres-the-internal-yahoo-no-work-from-home-memo-which-extends-beyond-remote-workers/), and that is favourably by potential employees who now want to be employed there.

**Environment Drives Culture; Culture Drives Brand**

Company management, [ones with pointy hair](http://dilbert.com/strip/2001-12-16), may only see benefits to adopting a remote first culture when an external positive response causes the Company share price to increase rather than it simply makes employees happy/motivated.

**What communication problems can be improved when the first assumption is that teams are not co-located?**

Remote First adoption by companies means that the weaknesses below are exposed and can be acted on for the benefit of all employees.

* Working at the HQ or working from Home should not be a zero-sum game.
  * You may need the flexibility to alternate to the most effective at a given time.

* Employees spread across floors or buildings can benefit from the change in Culture. 

* Senior Management traditionally works together at their local visibility level.

* For employees, attendance does not always equal productivity.
  * Traditional company Culture equates Work with just showing up and attending meetings.

* Lack of diversity in hiring. Employees must not be sourced from the same location.

* Retention of valuable employees is lost if they choose to relocate out of the area.

* Lack of knowledge sharing and the assumpution that everyone knows things at the same time.

* [Salaries](http://blog.onradpad.com/employees-are-paying-this-much-to-live-next-to-unicorns-in-sf/), [Rents](http://priceonomics.com/the-san-francisco-rent-explosion-part-iii/) and Commuting costs increasing in San Francisco/London make remote working more rational and logical.
  * Either that or Tech knowledge workers will have to live in conditions next to their place of [employment](https://www.apple.com/supplier-responsibility/progress-report/).
 
* If you are communicating by email then you are effectively remote.
  * Do employees read their emails aloud when working side by side?

* Email is an ineffective communication tool to raise tickets and get answers.
  * e.g Try contacting your IT Helpdesk - this what it feels like to get answers through an opaque channel.

* Provincial culture - local teams working in Desk Farms - local assumptions.
  * Poor knowledge sharing. Ever experienced contacting teams by email to source information? You may as well have sent your email to dev/null.

* Location becomes a single point of failure. Contingency Planning. Disaster recovery. Fire Drill.
  * Marching ants can recover.
 
* Depending on your circumstances the best time for productivity is lost commuting.

**Be intentional**

* As Remote First will raise more questions - what problems are you trying to solve?

* It's about being in control - otherwise you are simply a [minion](http://www.minionsmovie.com/minions.html).

* When the predominate method of working is online it should be apparent when the team absolutley needs to meet in person.

* If teams choose to work in the same location then provide a quality working environment - not Desk Farms.

* If one team member is remote, all the team is effectively remote in attitude and dedicated to supporting remote people.

* Video technologies allow everyone to show up to meetings equally so they can make decisions too.

* Remotes should not lag behind the decision makers because of the perception that speed is the deciding factor.

* Do not make distributed teams across timezones work outside of their normal scheduled hours.

* Todays software is built around the idea that you are not co-located - Mobile messaging, VOIP.
  * Companies that make this kind of software and are not Remote First, its like saying your products don't work.

* Tools gaining growth and mindshare that work locally and remote such as [Slack](https://slack.com/), [Discord](https://discordapp.com/), [Trello](https://trello.com/), [Zulip](https://zulip.org/), [AppearIn](https://appear.in), [Matrix](https://matrix.org/), [Distributed version control](https://github.com).

* Build a culture around asking questions

* Remote first teams can become increasingly skilful and have better empathy.
  * The skill set to acquire in the next few years is distributed working practices.

As [discussed](/facebook/2015/04/05/Facebook-openplan/), how do you compete for hires?

If you are Apple you can compete by building a [big space ship](http://www.cupertino.org/index.aspx?page=1107).

A Global Superpower is defined by having an aircraft carrier - a tech superpower has a corporate spaceship campus.

If the perception of your company is still taken from the inertia when it first put Radio on the Internet in 1999, then Remote First offers a methodology and a brand to make it relevant instead of adding ephemeral benefits like ping pong, catered lunches.

Initially, Teams can adopt practices faster than the whole company. Start there.
