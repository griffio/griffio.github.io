[Effective Kotlin Book]](https://leanpub.com/effectivekotlin/)

![Effective Kotlin Book](/public/effective_kotlin.jpg)

From author [Marcin Moskala](https://leanpub.com/u/mmoskala)

This is a reference to the printed edition from late 2019

Presented at 437 pages including a table of contents, however it doesn't contain an index.

**Do you need this book?**

Not especially a first take for beginners or if you prefer to get you answers from StackOverflow as
the material is designed around the trades off to effectively communicate Kotlin code in a development team.

Effectiveness can be considered the concept of being able to achieve better results through general rules of choice
rather than through explict measurements of efficiency.

*The cost* to mitigate is the time spent reading and understanding Kotlin code.

Not Android specific

Null is still a valid type in Kotlin and can be used effectively

The original Effective Java book, that I purchased in 2001, was a much needed insiders eye and much of it relates to adding
defensive programming that the Java Language and official API missed.

The Kotlin language addresses most of the "Effective Java" so it could be argued that the items raised are 
Data Classes, Null Safety

If you are performing a code review and need to justify a requested change or recommendation this book can give you 

Item 1. There are only brief references to coroutines or multi-threaded programming in handling mutability and state.

Kotlin has DSL (domain specific language extensions methods) and a more expression statements
Good Code
Code Design
Efficiency 

Kotlin has still the 
Danny Thorpe's Delphi Component Design from 1996 https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/524370

Effective Kotlin Coroutines could be an entire book too
