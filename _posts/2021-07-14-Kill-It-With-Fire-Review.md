**How to survive a legacy apocalypse?**

The book doesn't actually adovocate for destroying legacy systems, implementing a scorched earth approach as the title states - rather it's about identifying and adding value to them over time. This is a book, mainly, about large legacy projects and about cultivating mature systems that can be maintained.

To survive the apocalypse "If you don't cannibalize yourself, someone else will." - Steve Jobs

**Legacy systems** exist in Organisations because they were successful in their era of inception and contemporary technology has moved on leaving older systems marooned. Where as older systems that are not used can simply be turned off.

**The main contents** of the book are engineering transformation strategies that can be applied to Organisations with these questions 
What the stages are?
What the problems and messes are?
What the solutions are?
What the costs are?

The book provides thought exercises around the above questions

In this book, there are no code snippets or specific techniques for programming languages - such a book, for example would be 
[Working Effectively with Legacy Code](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/working-effectively-with/0131177052/)

**In the conclusion** the book states the hardest parts with turning legacy systems into maintained systems are interconnected with the Organisational structures and can be addressed with the correct feedback loops that re-inforces the value the systems has for the owners 

Perhaps We are headed toward Verner Vinge's far future programmer-archeologist of the mature programming environment - [the-arrival-of-the-programmer-archeologist](https://aallan.medium.com/the-arrival-of-the-programmer-archeologist)
