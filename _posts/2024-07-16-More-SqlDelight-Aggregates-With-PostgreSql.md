**Aggregate Expressions**

Support for [Aggregate Expressions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-expressions.html#SYNTAX-AGGREGATES) in [SqlDelight](https://cashapp.github.io/sqldelight/2.0.2/) `2.1.0-SNAPSHOT`

Using an aggregate function reduces multiple inputs to a single output value, such as the sum or average of the inputs.
An aggregate expression represents the use of an aggregate function across the rows selected by a query.
