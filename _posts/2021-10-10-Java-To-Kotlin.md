[Java to Kotlin]](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/java-to-kotlin/9781492082262/)

From Authors:- Duncan McGregor & Nat Pryce

This is a reference to the first printed edition August 2021 (401 pages)

The printed book also contains Bibliography and Index pages

Subtitled with "A Refactoring Guidebook"

There are **twenty-three chapters** that takes a refactoring from one concept "to" another concept

---

There is a lot of code in the book and is rendered quite small - so consideration should be made if you want to get the print version
compared with Atomic Kotlin 

This is a book about refactoring from Java and also refactoring Java developers themselves that are motivated enough

Though this is not a Kotlin learning book - it avoid Coroutines, libraries and frameworks 

Kotlin has enough "taste" that it appeals to maybe Python developers and possible encourage new developers onto the JVM 

Mobile developers on IOS (Swift) and Android (Java)

Java is enought to repel new adoption and intial inertia of the enterprise glory days 15-20 years ago.
The "grain" of the language shows through - Java "varnished" over with some Kotlin. 

Transformation - Kotlinate or Kotlinification 
The book takes the initial Java to Kotlin conversion that the Intellij IDEA can perform

Java begins to rely on annotation processors Lombok, AutoValue etc to become tolerable - these need to be built into the compiler
taking immutable values and transforming with functions 

** Chapter 21 ** Exceptions to Values
This takes are refactoring 
e.g Result<Data, Error>
[Scala 3 union](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/types-union.html) types are the most consice 

The key take-away is that keeping a system building and working is the most valuable refactoring

This book is beneficial as You are getting at least 5 years of Kotlin experiences from the authors
