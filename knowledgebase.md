###**Culture**

####Environment Drives Culture, Culture Drives Brand

**Making a Culture**
- An Organizations collective intelligence is its Culture
- Individually people are smart and have hidden talents
- An environment that gives employees the latitude to make use of these talents generates a Culture
- If a company doesn't care enough creating a better working environment what is the chance it cares about creating a Culture?

**Brand** is a form of group-think and can be toxic if inhaled internally - Output only - Corporate marketing often creates the brand first and implements it topdown - Brand is arrived at through the on going culture and not by simply inventing a set of values.

**Open Plan**
- Desk Farms
- Ear Cans
- Furniture Police
- Meetings
- Interruptions
- Forced Collaboration

#### Diversity

The most challenging problem in tech industry is not technical but ensuring diversity in that technical culture.
Software is about People and their motivations.
- Overcoming bias.
- The assumption that expertise is concentrated into one original demographic
- Cannot make any assumptions about a persons experience
- they didn't grow up with a personal computer
- e.g IRC use is not known by a lot of new developers
- Slack or other chat based tools may be better for on-boarding

Not everyone has a long history in tech or has a computer science background. This could include business people who are not used to or are intimidated by creating Software.
The assumption has been that developers hatched out of an egg knowing how to code. New developers are not new to life and could be a scientist, teacher, journalist with years of knowledge.

- It makes the team better as it improves recruitment
- The focus is on sourcing not on filtering
- Hiring for potential
- Fill the blind spots
- There is a business need for it
- e.g Bitly are a Python shop but are using GoLang to solve problems that Python is less suited for
- Attracting new developers with ideas rather than relying on incumbent developers that keep it the same
- Therefore hiring is encouraged to be diverse.

#### Recruiting

Hiring culture should be sourcing and inviting candidates for potential rather than filtering for exclusion
- Trivia tests for X
- A developer could memorize trivia for X but have never practised or used it
- When was the last time you learned/practiced/used X did you teach/explain/show it to anyone else?

The 'doughnut light' for hiring should always be on - add all job descriptions into GitHub for quick opensource win.

Consider a company Tech Blog
- The shop window for developers to see Environment/Culture/Brand

### Remote First

Working co-located can benefit from remote first. Information queries are received on one channel (email) and
should be copied/forward to another (chat, wiki).

Synchronising meetings across time zones - rolling meeting participants?
Co-located team members need to ensure updates are synchronised to remotes.

- Is determined by personal situation and the way I work.
- Remote teams will become increasingly skillful
- Choose the most effective location to be
- Skill-set to acquire in the next few years is distributed working practices
- Commuting doesn't give value for money vs productivity
- Tools with growth and mind- share that work local and remote such as Slack, Trello
- What tools will replace Slack? Not IRC but Slack.next.
- Existing tools Git, DVCS are peer to peer
- Today's software is built around the idea that you are not co-located - Mobile messaging, VOIP
- Cloud/web business is 24/7
- Software Development is not 9-5, "Second Shift" is possible
- Marching ants, disaster recovery - WeWork private offices located in hubs
- Contingency Planning. Disaster recovery. Fire Drill

Remote Distributed Lessons

- Remote working is a distributed protocol
- If one person is remote. Everyone works as if remote disposition
- No local privileges
- Catch everyone up to local conversations
- Establish communication channel for business changes
- Log of updates accessible across timezones
- Every party should access video chat and be in-sync
- Capturing information locally for future distribution. For team members that haven’t even started yet
- Herding Unicorns
- Prove ability can work remote and stay sane
- What is my threshold for productivity? Totally remote, Commute some of the week? Commute nearer?
- Team as Small social network - people share on twitter and message each other out-of-band communication.
- Some companies adopt remote, others were born remote
- Just write everything down even when in same office space

Create a new chat channel for a specific client - everyone involved jumps in.

Chat channel - able pick up more “over-heard” chatter and listen into conversations.

DiscordApp - https://github.com/reactiflux/volunteers/issues/25

#### Co-located

- Part of growing problem
- Adding to congestion
- Not value for money. 15-20k over 5 years
- Single Point of failure
- Best time of productivity is lost commuting
- Disregards people who are not here yet and anyone that may work on the project in the future
- Open Plan - open office space and worker wears headphones often shown in office culture photo ops
- Only achieving 1/10th of the productivity.

### Open Source

Open Source vs Corporate - In the corporate enterprise working environment there is rarely anything to show to the outside world for a days work
OpenSource allows the simplest solution to propagate. Commercial software has to meet the requirements of tenders and checklists of features
Anyone should be able to contribute to Open Source projects
- however the project maintainers may prefer test cases over patches due to the knowledge required to keep the code base systematic
  - e.g memory performance constraints that only committers have deep knowledge of e.g. Guava, RXJava
Twitter were able to use the JVM, Open JDK as they could customise the whole stack, add in performance enhancements and profiling tool support
Antidote to big vendors stack traditionally competed with Microsoft. Alternative to Microsoft binary-centric world
2000-2001 Jboss open source poking at the big vendors. First application server. Easy to run. Go with defaults

Good Open Source Project? [ReactiveX/RxJava](http://reactivex.io) Marble diagrams. Pull Requests. Committers welcome, some code however is sensitive to memory constraints - requires more knowledge
. Test cases welcomed instead

Open Source contribution: Dagger repo, I can see how many developers it helped out. TestNg - was first contribution

#### Problems in Open Source

For every Linus there are another hundred duck-sized Tovalds.

Liberal in input and conservative in output

Free speech who is right?

Open Source projects must support a code of conduct that defines a policy to avoid petty decisions and exclusionary behaviour.
- [NPM Inc](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/conduct)
- [ThoughtBot](https://thoughtbot.com/open-source-code-of-conduct)

Open Source Projects problems when focused around unmovable personalities (Trolls). Support exclusionary/hateful opinions

No HR in Open Source

2012, bootstrap, missing semi-colon vs JSMin - which one should change?
Adopting a coding style that does as much as possible to help keep them out of harm's way
Documenting things the project does that might not conform to external contributor expectations
Making explicit recommendations on tools and processes
https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/js/dropdown.js no semi-colons
Similar issues in that the code will work but be less inclusive to some users.Not Open Source. Output of relaxed Javascript style means that strict tools will fail
JSMin should accepted ASI but log error
Bootstrap should tighten up some of the relaxed Javascript by simply adding explicit if() instead of relying on newlines

2013, (libuv) used in node.js , a Joyent-sponsored project. One of the core contributors rejected a pull request that eliminated the use of a gendered pronoun in libuv
Just treat it a a writing bug - Newton's Third Law of Motion: To every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction. Then bug will never get fixed

### Agile

Software development as a time-boxed, risk, complexity evaluated process. Delivering software in a continuium rather than in big bangs. De-mystifying how Software is made. Like a sausage machine. Everyone is made aware how the sausage is made and how big each segment can be delivered.

Becomes Agile when software developers and stake holders (people with commercial interest in building software) are communicating skilfully and keeping iterating on the question of what they are actually trying to build.

Not Agile, if software developers are being approached directly for features, rather than the people who are asking for features understanding how that they can be empowered themselves to make software.

If a company doesn't care enough creating a better working environment what is the chance it cares about creating better software?

In the Business where does agility begin and end? Is there a radius of people that apply?

Teams can evolve faster than the parent organisation.

Software is structured so that it's easier to delete code safely.

### Scrum

Industrialised software process - not about creative thought - continual grind

Harmful to people https://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2015/06/06/why-agile-and-especially-scrum-are-terrible/

Box ticking for corporate enterprise cultures that cannot adopt a people first culture

#### TDD (Test Driven Design/Development)

Spend more time thinking about code to be written - more design time spent upfront is better than fixing incorrect code that made it into production (produced at initially faster rate)

If defects in code are caught mainly during development, instead of getting in production environment, then some kind of TDD is being used

Mocking - Usually undesirable. If mocking is good more mocking must be better?

Red/Green/Blue (Fail/Pass/Refactor)

http://blog.testdouble.com/posts/2014-01-25-the-failures-of-intro-to-tdd.html

Integration Tests are Applications - so not JUnit

Peer Programming, not Pair Programming
- Earliest possible moment at which to identify/fix code
- One, two or more developers
- Pair Programming is anaemic. Is it Pilot and Co-pilot? Motorcycle and Sidecar, Pantomime Horse?
- Peer Programming is familiar to online gaming. Immediate, get in the zone, headsets - may not even know team-mates.

Code Reviews
- Should not be the primary means of achieving code quality
- Knowledge sharing across the code base and across the team
- We can find and highlight examples of good code
- Even if we are not actively working on same code base

### Java

#### Why Java?

Stability - Brian Goetz. Current design goal. Use existing Java idioms, Backward compatible mostly. Language Evolution levels off. Evolution not Revolution.

Since 2000-2001 mainly because of mix open source choices and commercial like Intellij. There is no “one-stop” shop e.g Microsoft, Oracle, IBM

JVM has evolved. Even with lambdas and method functions its still stuck in a corner. Mainly it got stuck at Java 6 for a while due to Sun Micro auto-de-fa

Language stuck in a corner, no incentive to learn it. Compared to Swift, Exlir ,ironically, new adopters of Java Language are through Android, an illegal API Platform according to Oracle

There is a lot to improve in Java. Vast effort has gone into it from an active community. Suitable for long term development projects(5-10 years)

Guava - Provides idioms aimed at Java 5-7 users. Overlaps with Java 8 type and versioning incompatibilities. Public api dependency on types. Heavy on Android(Dex). Not so good for Open Source Projects. Large APIs, Breaking changes to libraries that use it. Can use guava but don't use in public api, can use shading to include needed classes. Java problem making the top-level Collections interface instances mutable.

Java and Domain models - For classic OOP Java is clumsy. Tiny Types (Autovalue), composition over inheritance (Traits, Mixins for multiple inheritance ). Does Scala work better?

Java URL class equals DNS IP address - URI

Java idiomatic changes - simple - means smaller but more classes (Firstname, DateOfBirth, SSN, Zipcode, Password, HtmlSafe)

Java makes good use of a single machine and reduces the need to scale horizontally

Mostly backward compatible. Thus Java is boring. Small changes e.g ForEach don’t impact type system. String can’t foreach over each Character of String. Boiler plate code that can be made concise. Don’t increase conceptual surface area, improve existing idioms.

Spring Framework has a proven track record for use in multi-year spanning projects. Upgrade path. 5yrs+. Java 6,7,8 compatibility (Single Abstract Methods).
e.g Springboot > Dropwizard which was cool in 2012. Spring has all the utilities when you actually need a Kitchen sink. Dependencies are collected together as bill of materials to get the correct stack of dependencies. The tide of dependencies rise at the same time in a monolithic framework.

We use something large like Spring when there are many application domains and facets that have to be supported simultaneously.

QueryDsl - Java Models could be under/over specified. Query models are separate to support predicates, extension methods, Predicates and DSL. (Add Temporal meaning to the model e.g after, before, completed ).

Java API should explicitly use Locale and CharSets.

Annotation Processors - There comes a point at which it better to use a JVM language with higher order expressions. Code generation for maintaining boiler plate code that is a liability on older Java versions.

Immutability - Java Memory Model (Final). Published Thread Safe. Object Graph must provide copies of data(clone) or wrap collections. To design smaller classes when adding features. Construction.

If you know Python, Ruby, Javascript - it is difficult to apply what you know to Java. Its feels too technically obtuse. E.g Twitter (FailWhale) wanted to run the JVM as it saturates a machine capabilities and choose Scala as developers from different backgrounds already understood higher-order abstractions.

Kotlin is a better Java 8 - infix operators, Higher Order Functions, Builder literals, generics, packages not file system relative, Operator overloading conventions. UnChecked Exceptions.

##### Java 8

java.util.Optional:-
Not to be a general purpose Maybe or Some type
Limited mechanism for library method return types where there needed to be a clear way to represent "no result", and using null for such was overwhelmingly likely to cause errors.
Probably should never use it for something that returns an array of results, or a list of results; instead return an empty array or list. You should almost never use it as a field of something or a method parameter.
Routinely using it as a return value for getters would definitely be over-use.

Java Fork/Join Framework - Doug Lea - introduce CPU instructions, e.g CAS, into JVM and expose through a library. Can be used by various JVM languages to implement Actors, etc.

Lambada (SAM)

Math.addExact

Exposes (via Unsafe) a fetch-and-add (XADD) instruction that classes such as AtomicInteger can take advantage of to implement their atomicity guarantees. This has a significant advantage over the Java 7 implementation, which instead relies on compare-and-swap (CAS). Improves Guava cache etc.

Java syncronized hardware level atomic transactions using TSX instructions.

#### Java Origins

Java is Virtual Machine Control Language -  a ‘C’ like language with a layer of 1990’s era Object Classes, also a reaction against C++. (e.g no pointers, only Single Inheritance from an implementation class)

Java was being positioned as application platform from Corel’s WordPerfect, similar to offerings in todays App Stores up to the level of a regular operating system. A systems programming language, a UI Widget class library.

A virtual machine control language for driving consumer electronics. A blue collar language that was meant to feel familiar.
1. It has an object-oriented flavour
2. Standard Numeric compatibility with IEEE 754
3. Java also has a systems programming flavour
4. Distributed flavour. Class Loaders
The most popular language this turned out to be is JavaScript, based on Scheme.

Original Reason for Java Exception Model.

"The exception model that we picked up pretty much straight out of Modula 3 has been, I think, a real success. Initially, I was somewhat anxious about it,because the whole notion of having a rigorous proof that an exception will get tossed can be something ofa burden. But in the end, that is a good burden to have. When you aren’t testing for exceptions, the codeis going to break at some time in any real environment where surprising things always happen. Ariane 5 provides a vivid lesson on how important exception handling is.Although exception handling makes Java feel some-what clumsy because it forces you to think about something you’d rather ignore, your applications are ultimately much more solid and reliable."

##### AOP

Java language is not expressive enough without some elements of code generation, reflection or AOP to workaround inheritance as a way of adding cross cutting behaviour. When all you have are classes; more is more

EJB1/2 example of pre-AOP component model that ultimately failed. With AOP (AspectJ) any Java application could now have “e.g Transactional” components without a vendor industry standard

#### Java Virtual Machine

JVM ecosystem can offer alternative tools e.g Clojure Leinigen, other testing frameworks ScaleCheck etc. Not stuck with Maven, Gradle, Junit

#### Functional Programming

Data In, Data Out

Pure function - Same input returns same output e.g 2+2=4

Side effects - In OOP an Object setter must imply a change to the objects environment

#### Object Oriented Programming

Polymorphism - Compiler doesn't know, Lazy binding in typed language. V-table dispatching

#### Programming

Remote API - Timeouts - options? :Retry :Fail :Ask

Eventual Consistency - When “facts” are distributed: ”The storage system guarantees that if no new updates are made to the object, eventually all accesses will return the last updated value.”. It is possible that stale information can be read until such time it will eventually be consistent with latest version of data. E.g Asking a circle of friends someones birthday, eventually the group will agree on the same answer.

Consistency - Data appears consistant across multiple devices - messages out of sync.

All Businesses are understanding they exist in a marketplace where developing software is increasingly dominate. First contact will be through mobile app. Agility is determined by how directly engaged the business is in creating software

Hypervisor allows multiple guest operating systems to run on a single system at the same time by virtualisation of the hardware

Be an ambassador for the customer inside your company, enabled to solve the problem on their behalf

Github is not a resume - its just source control that you can share with anyone. If you have created/configured/documented something for your own reference you may as well share it with everyone that comes across it


#### REST (Representational State Transfer)

Architecture style works with networked hypermedia applications. Course-grain hypermedia data transfer. Not Limited to Http

The application state is controlled and stored by the user agent and can be composed of representations from multiple servers. The model application is therefore an engine that moves from one state to the next by examining and choosing from among the alternative state transitions in the current set of representations

Imagine a resource /book with only backing state on the server, instead /book/42/page/1/para/5 represents the state driven by the client. State Machine

Roy Fielding - REST architecture style of the Internet, instead of RPC style Web Services. Hypermedia, stateless. HATEOAS - Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State. Hyper Media Constraints

e.g a Response data contains a self-linking URL. Richardson Maturity Model. “application/hal+json”; https://pushpay.io/docs/operations#post__v1_anticipatedpayments, https://reverb.com/page/api

Rest API - discoverable APIs, should a version need to be specified? Semantic versioning, backward/forward compatible, Content negotiation.

Rest Pagination - Links for next and previous pages, counts

For HTTP - you get a page of HTML data and embedded in that HTML you have links and forms that tell you what you can do with that data.

https://api.foxycart.com/docs
https://dmarc.postmarkapp.com/api/

One advantage of HTTP Caching is that is will work with any existing serverside data access layer (sql, orm).

#### Security, Secure Coding

Security -Evaluating Parser vs Embedded Scripting Lang - Parser doesn’t execute code; MVEL, Groovy etc can be used for code exploits. Java Serialization is also exploitable. Marshalling data - unpickling etc.

Secure web apps
- Authentication, Authorisation, CSRF, XSS, Sessions, CORS, CSP, Headers, Passwords, Injection, Encryption
- XSS is the most compromising as all can circumvent the other mechanisms 
- Context based - data place holder should be like SQL binding parameters

[Secure Coding - www.securecoding.cert.org](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/java/SEI+CERT+Oracle+Coding+Standard+for+Java)

Chain of trust
- Downloading Putty is not safe

Openssl goto fail -> code review fail? Code comprehension fail, the wrong eyes looking at code too familiar and excepting, code style, linting, TDD

De-Serialization of untrusted data - https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html

#### Micro Services

Service - application accesses external or component that is not local. (e.g database, messaging, socket)

Java Micro Services - JVM optimised for longer running monolithic code - Hot Reloading, URLClassLoader services, Memory Leaks, JMX, (Karaf) OSGI, http://fabric8.io/, Kubernetes etc

Really a patchwork of applications, Federated Services, separate databases, - different languages - e.g GoLang

Business apps have different lifespans based on how often the requirements changes. Obsolescence. Will a service need replacing in 5yrs?

Are they just lightweight CGI processes? Does it make sense on the JVM?

#### Software

Text Protocols JSON/XML - There are standard parser/processors in environments(browsers) support many representations of user defined data.

Json and XML have 1 version. Deserialisers for custom binary protocol have to be distributed to clients. Protobuf, Transit - static languages, dynamic languages. Gzip.

A Web Page is a tree-like structure, yet the W3C DOM is represented like Java API. e.g instead of querying, selectors, chaining; exposing an information model.  

Exclusivley use JSON for Web data formats
Don’t produce or consume XML as data
XML is for markup documents where you need things like Attributes, Processing Instructions, Namespaces.

Convention Over Configuration
Opinionated defaults - you have to agree with them as reasonable settings
Sometimes can becomce a maintenance problem as application gets more complicated. Need more intentional overrides.

Inversion of Control
- Don’t call framework code, framework calls into components

The Spring Project is an example of maintaining a forward and backward compatible framework (e.g for Java 6,7,8)
Developers can take it for granted - Engineering team for "free".
Other JVM languages - Clojure - developer can't assume anything is available.

Asynchronous Api: Failure should be a first-class concept

Libraries vs Frameworks - Selecting Libraries is more bespoke, can be a patchwork full of holes (e.g Security). Frameworks can have better oversight (e.g. out of the box security). Monolithic but have oversight. e.g Spring Security is built on Spring
Framework can version as a complete bill of materials (tide rises everything at the same time)

Libraries: License, Dependencies e.g Logging. Java version forward compatible

Percentage of feature usage? e.g SAML2 Post can be implemented using standard Java library

Tomcat 8 - Servlet 3.1, WebSockets, Comet, Connectors NIO (Non-blocking multiplexing)

Dynamic vs Static languages - cite examples: e.g TypeScript - optional, turning a dial to the amount of types that ripple through codebase (IntelliSense), Php Hack - security, speedup. Python Type Hints, Type Inference can help. Haskell programs can be reasoned through types. Haskell programs can be reasoned through types

Docker Containers - binary format for executing and linking applications, package management, dependencies, versioning. Developer friendly

HighCharts - Cheap. Pension modellers, Chart Zooming, IE 6,7,8 compatible

Web vs Native (App Store) - Web has most reach, Native requires constant updates, IOS upto 3 versions of XCode to build versions - backward compat etc. Android many users on old versions.

Process : Business team members working on creating a product that happens to be implemented in Software with developers

ORM - when application controls data - effectively moving Stored Procedures into Java
    - adding new column doesn't require maintaining sql
    - superficially can use different database dialects
    - caching and loading objects optimized
    - persistance by reachability
    - pagination is not a database concept
    - a read/write object graph of entities, difficult to design, mutable data

SQL - usually database specific dialect
    - duplicate work when adding columns, queries need to be maintained (c.r.u.d), sparse inserts, updates by usecase.
    - result mappings still required if using object oriented language
    - generating dynamic sql, templating language
    - sales reports, data warehouse, ad-hoc queries

Stored Procs - database program compiled and deployed - can encapsulate schema data (api)
             - only use when client should not perform transactions
             - VoltDB can hot-swap procs
             - limited data types, returning rows, batch dml  
             - database pooling invalidated connections on re-compile
             - returning rows and mapping data is limited
             - some security encapsulation - permissions/malicious sql
             - replacing middleware layer
             - possible reuse across systems. e.g create user proc
             - stored procs like a dll or library dependency

Strings in code - Human readable, file paths, SQL, Names etc are all conceptually different and should be represented as different user defined types at the language level.

Architect for your application needs instead of forcing it to fit the stack - can be a problem with Java Frameworks.
Startups are better at doing this and don't use often Java for this reason.

#### HTTP

401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, 200 OK, 201 Created, 202 Accepted

#### Release Management

Continuous Integration - XP practice to run automated test suites periodically. Make smaller integrations frequently, Dedicated server process, clean environment, Automates the build, build discipline, collects metrics. Parallelism. Artefacts are created for deployment and distribution as early as possible. Leads to Continuous Deployment

Downsides - Darkside of CI Servers, e.g. Bamboo, are like Death Stars. Used to intimidate, ravenous consumption of time/resource with a tendency to blow up

Git vs Subversion: Distributed Authority vs Host Based Single Authority
Git - content addressable key/value store (.git/objects) - SHA1 checksums. Files, Directories

Rollbacks must be instant and easy because sometimes things are going to break and getting back to a working state quickly must be painless and fast
Patch releases must be able to make it from SCM to production (through a continuous delivery pipeline) in minutes
Load balancer must be able to handle automatic switching between releases
Database schema changes should be decoupled from app releases otherwise releases and rollbacks can be blocked
App-tier servers should be stateless with state living in external data stores otherwise state will be frequently lost and/or inconsistent

Git : branching
      GitFlow ( Master (current release), Develop) “—no-fastforwarding” merge commits
      Single Master, then feature/hotfix branches
      git help workflows

https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/blob/master/protocol/git/README.md

#### Versioning

Guava Library dependency published in an open source framework is problematic in that it is so widely installed at clients how to ensure that versions don’t clash
Client may have latest version and some methods deprecated in version depended in Open Source Library. Your application can only use one version. Open Source Library may not get updated frequently

Git SHA as version number for dependencies

Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
- PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes
- Breaking Version, (^)Feature Version, (~)Patch Version (Bug fixes automatically)
- Version numbers are system protocols, only names matter to be human readable

The major number is incremented when the API to the package or application changes in backwards incompatible ways.

The minor number is incremented when new features are added to the API without breaking backwards compatibility. If the major number is incremented the minor number returns to 0.

The patch number is incremented when no new features are added but bug fixes are released. If the major or minor numbers are incremented this returns to 0.

A pre-release is a . separated list of identifiers following a -. For example, 1.2.3-beta.1. These are optional and are only needed for pre-release versions. In this case 1.2.3 would be a release version following a pre-release like 1.2.3-beta.1.

The final section of information is build metadata. This is a . separated list of identifiers following a +. This is different from pre-release information and should be ignored when determining precedence.

While the spec doesn’t list anything about a v prefix on a semantic version they are sometimes present. For example, you might see a semantic version as v1.2.3. In this case the v should be ignored.

Or mnemonic Breaking.Feature.Fix to use instead.

#### NoSql

Functionality, does it exist in Postgres already?

“document store”, ”blob storage”, “key/value storage”, “nested table”, “graph database”, “distributed table”, “log database”, “distributed filesystem”

Security - lack of auth, must be firewalled

NewSql
- Voltdb

#### Languages

https://elixir-lang.org/ - Erlang dynamic

http://elm-lang.org/ - Javascript functional

https://haxe.org/ - strictly typed cross-platform Javascript

https://golang.org/ - Garbage collected - typed - static runtime binaries

https://www.idris-lang.org/ -  pure functional dependent types

https://nim-lang.org -  statically typed

https://www.rust-lang.org/ - Safety instead of C++

http://www.purescript.org/ -  Strongly-typed functional Javascript

https://kotlinlang.org/ - statically typed cross platform

As a cautious developer there is a balance between learning and applying new technology without good cause. Boring is good. However, it is more difficult to have flexible employment choices when relying on mature skills. For example, Long time Javascript developers lamenting on loosing out to ReactJS developers with less experience.
The front-side UI technologies bear the brunt of change as there is more advantage to implementing a new api, e.g ReactNative, users want faster interaction, more data like a desktop application - all about the Frames per second.
